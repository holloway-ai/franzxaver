## Introduction

Hi, I'm here to introduce to you, you are our first from whole Holloway family of Enterprise Assistants.

## Our Team

Juan is responsible for knowing everything in your company, but first things first, our team is from Peru, Moldova, Austria, and I personally live in Germany, and we all gather together to solve one simple problem.

## The Problem

The problem is that we are really spoiled by quality of Google search. So spoiled that every time we need to find something in our corporate systems, we suffer, because they usually use the keyword search, the old style, not the modern one that Google, not modern one, semantic, that Google use.

But the problem is much bigger, that a lot of knowledge is hiding in the recorded webcast, like you are looking now.

## The Solution

Imagine that all video presentation of business processes, systems, solutions, or ever greater ideas in your company will be converted into the Wikipedia pages and will be searchable by modern search engines. And that's exactly our, what Juan Holloway is doing.

## Demo

Let me show you. To make a demo, we convert some results from previous hackathons into our Wikipedia.
