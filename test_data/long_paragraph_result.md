## Introduction
Hello everyone, this is a video presentation for a product that is not alone. We are team uncomplicated. And this we are basically a team of three people who are very passionate about AI. My name is Hiram Chandla and I'm a machine learning engineer at Simplified. And we have Ishan Dutta who is a deep learning researcher at TreeFace. And we have Vatsal Sakaria who is a front end intern at Toddlab.Now why did we even build Not Alone? That was the reason that we came up with it. So we often saw that people with dyslexia often find it hard to, you know, just read and write. Primarily because, you know, in an interview, we saw someone talking that it's hard for them to mentally lock in onto a word or particular sentence. So that's how the idea just popped out. Like, we just thought, like, what could we do to help them get better at reading or writing? So we started doing some research and we found that it's often easier for them to read on electronic devices rather than reading the real document itself. And that's something that became the foundation of our whole product. So some key points that we wanted to address. First is we wanted to help them read better. And in order to do that, we had to build a UI that is especially helpful for dyslexic people to read. Now second is we wanted them to write better. Now what we saw after researching is that dyslexic people often use some third party ESL service that would help them write instead of, you know, just having them type out a sentence. They can just talk, speak into it and it will type about it. Now third is assisted writing. Now you have a text generated out of ESL or some service. You want to enhance that text. And this is why we built some out of the box features using chat GPT, which could help you enhance the quality of your text. Fourth is a helping hand. Now dyslexic people often have some sort of guide, a sort of a guide that is with them helping them out. But what if you don't have that? What if you feel lost at some point?
