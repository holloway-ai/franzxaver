What's the text?"}, {"role": "user", "content": "### Generative AI\nThere's a newer branch of machine learning that's been really useful. **Generative AI** and some of the geometry tools that evolve these creations have been playing a major role in having people being able to develop things through AI without actually having to know much coding. So basically there's a deep learning algorithm that can take your text and create an image.\n\nAnd there are tools in geometry that are able to evolve and kind of massage out what you  want from the image.  This is an example on the left of a place that does not actually exist.  But I created it with one of the open source tools out there.  And this can be really useful, as we'll see.  So let's get into the applications.  So a few of the projects that I've used persistent homology on are looking at urban growth tipping  points.  So as cities grow, especially if there's not a lot of infrastructure or planning going  on when cities start evolving, we can run into problems with infrastructure, we can  run into problems with public health and sanitation, and we can end up with environmental issues  if there's a tipping point that results in a lot of growth without enough time to build  all of the things needed to keep a city running.  We can also look at climate change and understand when there are points of no return, when the  climate is going to tip, when populations aren't safe living in an area anymore.  And this is really important to be able to relocate populations before a disaster happens  in their area or before the area is unlivable, such as barrier islands, communities on rivers,  areas near the Sahara, which are dealing with a lot of deforestation and evolution into  desert climates.  In addition, with the recent COVID epidemic, this is also really important in understanding  epidemic growth so that we can position resources, especially in communities that may not have  a lot of starting resources.  Being able to understand where and when we need to place these resources can go a long  way in preventing the spread of an epidemic and limiting the loss of life during one.  Norman Ricci curvature is another tool that I use a lot in my work."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok, I get it.
