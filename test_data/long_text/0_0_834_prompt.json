And I've focused a lot on public health, social sciences, and a lot of mathematical tools that  can be used to study both of these.  So let's go through some of the tools.  We're not going to get into details here too much.  Just kind of what the tools are and how we can use them.  So the first tool is something called persistent homology, which comes from a branch of math  called topology.  This branch is not real concerned with how your data is put together in the local sense.  It's more about how your data is connected.  So basically we create a series of distance-based objects and look at features across them.  This does connect back to geometry and the curvature and the distances that you define  in your data.  But it's a little broader of an overview.  The next tool is Furman-Ritchie curvature, which is a network science metric.  We just had a great two presentations on network science and how useful it is.  This tool measures the curvature on the graph.  So in physics, when we have a lot of matter in the same spot, it pulls everything towards  it.  So black holes are going to pull planets towards it, pull your spaceship towards it.  And the same thing happens in networks.  When we have a lot of things that are connected in the same area of the graph, processes that  happen on a graph tend to get pulled into there.  So if you're looking at marketing campaigns, it tends to clump around that area.  If you're looking at epidemics, that's typically where you're going to find a lot of cases.  And in general, this is a very useful tool for understanding change points and behavior  over time on graphs.  There's a newer branch of machine learning that's been really useful.  Generative AI and some of the geometry tools that evolve these creations have been playing  a major role in having people being able to develop things through AI without actually  having to know much coding.  So basically there's a deep learning algorithm that can take your text and create an image."
