{~0.00} I'm Colleen Farley. {~8.12} I live in Miami, Florida. {~10.20} I am the author of *The Shape of Data*, which will be coming out this next year. {~16.20} And I've focused a lot on public health, social sciences, and a lot of mathematical tools that {~24.44} can be used to study both of these. {~28.96} 

## Tools
{~28.96} So let's go through some of the tools. {~32.08} We're not going to get into details here too much. {~35.92} Just kind of what the tools are and how we can use them. {~40.40} 

### Persistent Homology


{~40.40} So the first tool is something called persistent homology, which comes from a branch of math {~45.50} called topology. {~47.64} This branch is not real concerned with how your data is put together in the local sense. {~54.92} It's more about how your data is connected. {~59.00} 

{~59.00} So basically we create a series of distance-based objects and look at features across them. {~66.32} This does connect back to geometry and the curvature and the distances that you define {~72.64} in your data. {~73.64} But it's a little broader of an overview. {~80.12} 

## Furman-Ritchie Curvature

{~80.12} The next tool is Furman-Ritchie curvature, which is a network science metric. {~85.72} We just had a great two presentations on network science and how useful it is. {~92.96} This tool measures the curvature on the graph. {~96.28} 

{~96.28} So in physics, when we have a lot of matter in the same spot, it pulls everything towards {~102.76} it. {~103.76} So black holes are going to pull planets towards it, pull your spaceship towards it. {~108.88} And the same thing happens in networks. {~110.36} When we have a lot of things that are connected in the same area of the graph, processes that {~117.04} happen on a graph tend to get pulled into there. {~120.12} 

{~120.12} So if you're looking at marketing campaigns, it tends to clump around that area. {~124.72} If you're looking at epidemics, that's typically where you're going to find a lot of cases. {~130.22} And in general, this is a very useful tool for understanding change points and behavior {~136.12} over time on graphs. {~140.08} 

### Generative AI and Geometry Tools

{~140.08} There's a newer branch of machine learning that's been really useful. {~144.80} Generative AI and some of the geometry tools that evolve these creations have been playing {~151.40} a major role in having people being able to develop things through AI without actually {~159.16} having to know much coding. {~161.50} So basically there's a deep learning algorithm that can take your text and create an image. {~168.08} And there are tools in geometry that are able to evolve and kind of massage out what you {~176.24} want from the image. {~178.32} This is an example on the left of a place that does not actually exist. {~183.52} But I created it with one of the open source tools out there. {~187.52} And this can be really useful, as we'll see. {~193.14} 

## Applications

{~193.14} Let's get  {~197.52} 

{~197.52} So a few of the projects that I've used persistent homology on are looking at urban growth tipping {~203.72} points. {~205.52} So as cities grow, especially if there's not a lot of infrastructure or planning going {~212.72} on when cities start evolving, we can run into problems with infrastructure, we can {~217.48} run into problems with public health and sanitation, and we can end up with environmental issues {~223.24} if there's a tipping point that results in a lot of growth without enough time to build {~230.96} all of the things needed to keep a city running. {~233.66} 

### Climate Change

{~233.66} We can also look at climate change and understand when there are points of no return, when the {~240.28} climate is going to tip, when populations aren't safe living in an area anymore. {~244.72} And this is really important to be able to relocate populations before a disaster happens {~250.36} in their area or before the area is unlivable, such as barrier islands, communities on rivers, {~259.88} areas near the Sahara, which are dealing with a lot of deforestation and evolution into {~267.52} desert climates. {~269.56} 

{~269.56} In addition, with the recent COVID epidemic, this is also really important in understanding {~276.32} epidemic growth so that we can position resources, especially in communities that may not have {~282.40} a lot of starting resources. {~285.12} Being able to understand where and when we need to place these resources can go a long {~289.80} way in preventing the spread of an epidemic and limiting the loss of life during one. {~297.64} 

{~297.64} Norman Ricci curvature is another tool that I use a lot in my work. {~303.72} Right now, there's a huge crisis in food prices. {~307.64} So this is impacting a lot of communities. {~310.96} Middle class populations are finding themselves being driven back into poverty with rising {~315.70} food prices. {~317.52} And there's a lot of food insecurity that has started, especially since the Ukraine {~321.48} conflict. {~323.08} So understanding when prices are going to change, what prices are going to change, and {~328.00} where they're going to change allows social programs to be able to meet these needs. {~333.84} 

{~333.84} It allows food aid programs to be able to know how much aid they may need to meet the {~341.16} need of the communities, as well as what governments can do locally to reduce the price of food {~347.76} and help populations get through rough patches. {~352.08} 

{~352.08} One of the first times that I used these models on a project was during the DR Congo 2018 {~359.16} Ebola outbreak. {~361.64} The outbreak happened in an under-resourced area of the country, and getting resources {~368.46} in the areas impacted was difficult for NGOs and for local responders. {~375.48} And being able to understand where and when the next wave of the epidemic would hit helped {~382.64} be able to position those resources to respond accordingly and in areas of greatest need. {~389.94} 

{~389.94} There's another use, more common in marketing, but also with behavior change, of understanding {~397.56} where in a social network or a geographic network an intervention can be done. {~403.66} So say you want to have a smoking cessation program or a sexual health education program {~411.64} that tips behavior change at a population level. {~416.68} 

{~416.68} Understanding how your network is put together and who has the influence in the network to {~422.32} be able to impact change on a population level without having the resources to intervene {~427.12} on everyone, having these type of tools is really, really useful to be able to selectively {~434.20} target different populations or different individuals within the population to affect {~440.40} the system level change. {~445.70} 

## Generative AI

{~445.70} So last we have generative AI. {~449.78} One of the things that I've found is that this is very useful in public health education. {~454.22} So during the COVID outbreak, we had mass campaigns, vaccination campaigns to try to {~460.10} help improve population health and protect vulnerable populations. {~465.14} However, there are a lot of caveats with doing public health in remote places with certain {~473.34} populations. {~475.66} Being able to make something culturally relevant is really important. {~480.42} To people who look like the community, being the image or the person speaking is really {~488.74} important to be relatable. {~492.04} And generative AI allows us to create culturally relevant images for these campaigns. {~498.66} 

{~498.66} In addition, they're really useful as a way to be able to do this with under-resourced {~505.38} areas, areas that don't have maybe as much infrastructure around creating videos, creating {~516.26} image campaigns, creating public service announcements. {~519.70} Having this technology allows the resources to go further. {~524.42} Long time ago, when I was working on HIV education in South Africa, there wasn't a lot to go {~532.82} on and a lot of it had to be developed on the fly. {~536.02} And that's very hard to do when you're in a rural community. {~539.62} It's a lot of finding people, positioning, whatever skit or whatever materials need to {~547.06} be created, actually creating those materials. {~550.38} It used to take a lot of time 20 years ago. {~554.30} But now with generative AI, we can tell our algorithm what we want to generate, generate {~561.58} 10 images or 100 images, and then look through them for what's most likely to resonate with {~568.90} the population. {~570.34} And that's really impactful. {~572.50} 

{~572.50} And I think in the future, we're going to be seeing a lot more of these technologies {~577.42} being leveraged in fields that might not have used these, in marketing, in public health, {~585.46} in social program awareness campaigns, pretty much anything that needs to get the information {~592.50} out, particularly in a visual manner. {~596.02} 

{~596.02} So a lot of areas of the world have a lot of local languages. {~601.02} And somebody who is a native speaker of that language might know some of the more dominant {~606.54} language messages can get lost in translation. {~611.86} Or there might be a need to hire a lot of translators to get the information out there. {~617.38} And this technology promises to really help solve a lot of those barriers to public health {~625.86} interventions, social policy announcements, even just getting information about what resources {~632.84} exist to these populations. {~637.96} 

{~637.96} So one of the things that I'm really passionate about is the need for representation. {~643.94} 

### Importance of Representation

{~643.94} So if we don't collect data on people who look a certain way or speak a certain language {~649.82} or come from a certain area of the country or the world, we don't have that data for {~655.42} our algorithms to learn from. {~657.32} And those populations may not have their needs met. {~660.04} If we don't have that representation on tech teams, we don't have that perspective of how {~665.30} there might be barriers to adopting the technology or having the technology work correctly within {~671.78} that population. {~673.26} So it's really important that we consider different cultures and different subgroups {~678.30} so that everyone can participate. {~680.30} I think we're at a tipping point within tech of those who are benefiting a lot from it {~686.58} and those that haven't benefited much. {~689.12} And if we keep going this way and some populations have a lot more representation than others, {~695.02} I think we're going to be seeing more and more division along the lines of technology. {~699.48} So that's really important, especially within social good projects that we have representation {~705.22} from the community, that the community has ownership in data, input into how this is {~711.18} going to be used or impact their community. {~716.10} 

## Resources

{~716.10} So there are a lot of good resources out there. {~719.70} I'm going to make this presentation public on my LinkedIn. {~724.86} So feel free to reach out to me. {~727.74} Feel free to look at these resources for the tools that are out there. {~733.54} 

{~733.54} - Persistent Homology has a lot of packages that exist in  {~739.74}
