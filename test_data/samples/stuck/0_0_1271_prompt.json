We are digital support gurus and we are a team of skilled Nigerian developers committed to pushing the boundaries of AI integration with our smart customer support chatbots. We are a team of technical and non-technical persons. First on the list is myself, Donald Nkuru. I'm a backend developer. Next we have Okechukwu Lovett, a product designer, Omemboji Emmanuel, a frontend engineer, Edika Chidemma Obaye, a copywriter, and Chinnedu Asogwa, a software developer. Now a little overview of our project. Our mission is to create an advanced e-commerce chatbot that improves user satisfaction by retaining history, supporting multiple languages, having sentimental analysis, intent recognition, and a recommendation system. Now the problem is that there are so many shortcomings in the current e-commerce chatbots. We have done the research and we have found out that there are so many barriers when it comes to language and understanding of the customer's sentiments and intents, so we have overcome this with the making of our customer support chatbots. By that way, we increase customer loyalty and engagement and benefit the company's bottom line. Here are the features of our chatbots. A recommendation system, intent recognition, sentiment analysis, multilingual support, and customer history retention. For our business model, we offer a monthly subscription-based business model that offers a value-packed experience at $50. Our journey began with a deep dive into the world of language models, where we discovered the incredible potential of Langchain, a Python framework tailored for developing applications powered by language models. Harnessing the capabilities of two exceptional models, we embarked on a mission to create an unparalleled customer experience. Our approach is nothing short of extraordinary. By combining two exceptional models, we have created an unrivaled shopping assistant chatbot, and the Anthropy Clouds model takes center stage, utilizing its remarkable 100K context window to deliver unparalleled results, ensuring a seamless and engaging customer experience. Meanwhile, the OpenAI model plays a pivotal role in tracking chat history and intelligently prompting follow-up questions. Our technical prowess doesn't stop there. We have harnessed the power of OpenAI embeddings, enabling our chatbots to delve deep into the director space and find the most relevant and similar pieces of text. This ensures that our customers receive personalized and tailored support, optimizing their shopping journey. To further enhance our system's efficiency, we have leveraged Redis as a vector store, enabling lightning-fast retrieval and storage of vectors. This empowers our chatbots to deliver real-time responses and maintain a smooth and solid conversation flow. Now, let's look into a demonstration of how our chatbot works. As you can see, we have a custom message asking what we are looking for today. So I'm going to check for an iPhone case. And as you can see, we have a list of items which it has recommended to us. Hard black case, soft shell case, wallet case, screen protectors. So depending on what we choose, it will give us more details on it. We have also deployed our application on Streamlit, which enables us to have lightning-fast front-ends in order to work with machine learning libraries and language models. We the digital support gurus are here to revolutionize the way you engage with e-commerce, one conversation at a time. Prepare to be amazed as we redefine the very essence of customer support. Get ready for an extraordinary journey where technology meets innovation and customer satisfaction reaches new heights. Welcome to the future of e-commerce support."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Ok, I get it.
