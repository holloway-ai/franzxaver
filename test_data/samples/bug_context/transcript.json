The problem that I want to solve with this application is actually more urgent than ever because I have an exam tomorrow at 8 30 a.m. in the morning and the problem I'm countering is we're giving so much material in the form of lecture recordings, pdfs, slides, maybe some past exams, maybe even have a notion page where you took some notes, you know, your study material can take different forms and it's just a bit overwhelming trying to understand all concepts and yeah maybe you want to catch up on the lectures but you have 10 videos to watch in like three days which each an hour long and it's just a bit difficult to prepare. Maybe you're struggling to prepare for an exam in this program and this problem is what I'm trying to solve with my program and here's my solution. An AI StudyBody, an interactive way to prepare for exams, helps you summarizing your study material based on your input and your input can be in any form once it's fully implemented, maybe not with the current prototype but that's the core idea basically and it's an easy way and maybe a more efficient way to prepare for your exam and you even can get some feedback on your answers. My program can generate some questions for you, some multiple choice questions but also some open questions. Yes, here's my prototype. Obviously within two days I wasn't able to generate an impressive looking prototype but you get the idea. Maybe it's missing some colors but hey, this is your basic GUI and then on the right side you can see I've loaded a lecture video into my program and then it generated a summary based on that lecture recording. Here you can see actually one exercise sheet that my program generated. This is a medium difficulty and it generated some multiple choice questions and on the right hand side you can see an exercise sheet which contains open-ended questions. Which should be more difficult in its nature. Let me show you a quick demo. I'm going to drag in my application here and I'm going to select a lecture video. Let's go with this one. Public versus private IP address. It's around 10 minutes long and the format of mp4. My program is now converting this mp4 to mp3 and then making the API call to whisper retrieving a transcription of that audio file. This is going to take about 20 seconds or so, 20 to 30 seconds and once that's done the title of my lecture will be displayed here and I can go ahead and generate a summary. Now the summary is using the chat GPT API so based on my transcription it's now generated a summary for me which I can go and read. I can go ahead and save this if I wanted to. Read through this a couple of times and if I feel confident with the content of this lecture I can go ahead and generate an easy exercise sheet for example. Now this should be fairly straightforward to answer. It's going to contain some multiple choice questions and based on the content of that transcription. Now if I feel more confident I can go ahead and generate a medium difficulty exercise sheet. This in nature is also based on multiple choice questions. Now finally a difficult exercise sheet which contains open questions. Now these questions are more difficult and it's going to take some time to answer these and you can actually go ahead and save this as a text file and then sit down and take your time and try and answer these. I have a submit answer button which basically what you can do you can go ahead and what's an IP address you can go ahead and answer this for all these questions. You can then submit the text file again and it's going to generate some feedback for you. It's going to give you a grade. Right now I'm not going to demonstrate this but it is definitely on my list but in two days that was a little bit difficult to achieve. Let me just do this again with another demo. I'm going to use another video. Hello everyone. This is about random access memory. So right now it is changing the file form from mp4 to mp3 again and then it's generating a transcription of that video. Now this is in length about 15 minutes so that's going to take a few seconds. Right my transcription is done. You can see the name for lecture appears here. I can go ahead and generate a summary of that transcription which can show up in my big text box here and this is a bit longer than the previous one because I'm going to be doing a 15 minute video. I can go ahead and read this a few times and if I feel comfortable I can now test myself with an exercise sheet. Now here again I can choose a difficulty level and these are some straightforward questions, some multiple choice questions. Now if I feel more confident I can go ahead and test myself with a test sheet. So I can go ahead and test myself with a test sheet. So I can go ahead and test myself with a test sheet. So I can go ahead and generate a difficulty exercise sheet. Difficult exercise sheet apologies. And here I have some open questions again which can take me some time to answer. And yes that's it for the little demo. Let's dive in back to my presentation. Current limitations. Yes sources of input. You know given the time frame of this hackathon it was practically impossible to code up several sources of input. And yeah the feedback is not as precise as I want it to be I mentioned as I mentioned earlier. And I mean this relates to the this is a bit answer feature. Giving feedback on generate summary here I actually mean that maybe when you read the summary you're not happy you think like something is missing. There should be a text box where you can then you know be in contact with the with the chat GPT API to ask it to generate another summary with your suggested suggested changes. And right now it takes some time to transcribe. I mean this 15 minute video took about 30 to 40 seconds to transcribe. Not bad but for read time for real application this is definitely not good enough yet. So there needs to be some work done here. But I believe there's lots of potential for this because I believe many people could make use of this and it's a it's a more fun way and a more efficient way to study and prepare for exams or tests. And I even thought about some other features including like flashcards the program could generate some flashcards for you making it even easier to study for your exam. One of the feature I thought of was the program giving you an open question and you can then get a chance to record your answer. So maybe so that would be almost like an oral evaluation you know and then you can get some feedback on that. So there's lots of potential lots of different features could be implemented. I believe the use case is many people could make use of this and yeah using these new emerging technologies. Always by API, chat GPT API. Yeah this concludes my presentation and we'll see you tomorrow if my application helped me in any way to prepare for my exam. Thank you so much for watching."}
