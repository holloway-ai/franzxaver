Our team is known as the Night Owls and we've dedicated the last 48 hours into building a project hosted by LabLab AI which involves using chat GPT and Whisper API. Our project is called Text Talk. With the increasing remote working environment, cultural diversity has become an integral part of our workflow with tons of expertise from different areas of the world. Noticeably, technical communication and complex explanations are often done better when people speak their native languages to one another. There are usually cases within work remote meetings where an excuse is taken to communicate a business or tech problem to an engineer in the preferred language. So the goal of our solution is to create a language optimizer using audio to text and video conversion. It's an app that converts audio to text and further outputs a video with more context in the preferred languages and dialects for better understanding. With this app, we believe that we can save time and increase the chances of an optimal input that otherwise would have been affected by communication lapses. Before I proceed, here's a quick team introduction. So five of us have met in the past few days to join this hackathon and these are the main guys that worked on this project. So we have Ali Raza, a full stack developer, Omer, a data scientist, Inam, a machine learning engineer, Tayab Zain, and Mariam, a data scientist. We haven't slept in the past few days just to ensure we had this 48 hour hackathon working right. So our inspiration stems from multiple studies and experiences within the workforce. One example is a CDC racial and ethnic disparity survey that found that there were 22% of workers in 2020 through June 2021. And the percentages of workforce contributions were spread across different races, as you can see in the table in the list below. We're considering this as an opportunity rather than a disparity by creating an environment where language, translation, dialects, and accents would be useful for effective communications. Other areas of our inspiration was from understanding that there are benefits of language preservation, which the main focus here is cognitive development. This is highly associated with being able to preserve your language and being able to apply your mental state to understanding things better because you speak in a language that you're accustomed to. A lot of applications have been built to resolve language and communication barriers. Duolingo, for example, is used for learning different languages and Speechify for text conversion. While we consider that those are good options for optimizing workflows and communication, our idea is to take it a step further. So in addition, we have designed a new way to use ChatGPT and WhisperAPI to provide a possible solution for this problem. Here's a high level view of our work environment and flow diagram. To the left, you can see the environments that we mostly focus on. On the right, you can see we started off with an input audio and then we convert the audio to text using the ChatGPT language model. The language detection is then integrated using WhisperAPI. This leads to an AI-generated video that's in sync with the text. And then we get a final output, which is a video with text subtitles, suiting the preferred language."}
